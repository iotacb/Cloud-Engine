# What is Cloud?
Cloud is a game creation library written in Java based on LWJGL.
LWJGL is the foundation of the Cloud, Cloud is written ontop of it.
Cloud is not made for professional usage, it's made for Java beginners that want to create a little game.


# What libraries are used?
- [LWJGL](https://lwjgl.com/) the foundation of the library
- [PI4J](https://pi4j.com/) for usage on a RaspberryPi

# What is possible with Cloud?
As I said, Cloud is just made for little projects.
But you can create for example a little 2D shooter or something else in a little amount of time.

# How to start?
To start using Cloud, download the source code of it and add it to your project. That way, you can change stuff of Cloud on the fly. So if theres something bothers you, you can change it how you want it to be.
The next steps will be explained in the [tutorial projects](). (Will be added soon!)
