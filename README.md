# What is Cloud?
Cloud is a simple Java 2D game library. It is just a little fun project for myself, and I created it because I wanted to make a little game in Java. So I wanted to make one using LWJGL, but I find it to complicated and confusing for just some small and simple games. I tried to make Cloud very user friendly and not to complicated to understand.

# What libraries are used?
- [LWJGL]() for the main structure of the library
- [JACo]() for playing audio files, I'll replace it with a self made one later.

# What is possible with Cloud?
As I said, Cloud is just a fun project so you shouldn't use it if you want to make a big and extensive game.
I made some little demo games, go watch them [here](https://github.com/iotacb/Cloud-Library/tree/master/demos).
