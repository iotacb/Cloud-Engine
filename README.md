Cloud is a library build ontop of LWJGL to make the usage of LWJGL easier.
You don't have to write a lot of code before rendering something in a window.
Cloud is made for 2D projects so if you want to create something in 3D you have to look somewhere else.

## How to get started
Just head over to the release page of cloud and download the latest version of it.
Then add the downloaded jar to the classpath of your Java project.

## Why?
I created cloud to make the process to get something on screen using LWJGL easier, because I think in LWJGL it does take alot of code and time just to open a window and even more to get something rendered.
But still you shouldn't use it for a big game or something like that because for that you still should use LWJGL directly.
Cloud is great for Java beginners which want to create a game!

### Coming soon
- Improve the performance of the library
- Collision System
- Audio System
